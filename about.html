								<p>I am currently a senior at the University of Michigan.  I anticipate graduating on April 28th with a Bachelor of Science in Information.  I am currently studying user experience design within this major.  I really enjoy it, and hope to get a job working with a team of UX researchers.  <br><br>


								This year, I completed a thesis paper for my research.  I work in Becker Lab as an undergraduate research assistant under the mentorship of my grad student, Katie.  The lab focus is sex differences in drug addiction, in which Katie and I focus on how gonadal hormones impact motivation in female rats.  This research is very interesting, for female sexual motivation is not well studied in comparison to males.  Learning how female rats are motivated for specific rewards can help develop paradigms to design a multitude of studies involving sexual dysfunction as a side effect of drugs.  We just completed one phase of our study, and look forward to moving onto the second one <br><br>

								I love the University of Michigan, and I am sad that I have to be leaving soon.  I have made some great friends while here, and learned from some excellent professors.  Outside of class, my favorite hobbies are going to Rick's and Skeeps with my friends, attending football games at the Big House, eating at the delicious Ann Arbor restaurants located downtown, and going to brunch with my friends.  I love breakfast foods, so my favoirte Ann Arbor restaurant is Sava's- I love their Bandito Hash!</p>
